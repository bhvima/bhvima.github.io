A NASA Student Launch Experience

<h1 class = "display-6">Introduction</h1>

I had the opportunity to participate in the NASA Student Launch competition, a prestigious event that challenges college teams to design, build, and launch rockets with scientific payloads. As the payload lead, I had the privilege of guiding our team's ambitious project, Project OWL. Our objective was to develop an innovative payload that could autonomously capture the surrounding area of a launch vehicle. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me a lot about engineering, teamwork, and innovation. Throughout the process, we encountered numerous challenges, from designing and integrating the camera system to ensuring its seamless operation upon landing. Join me as I recount the incredible experience of leading this transformative project in the NASA Student Launch competition.
